\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have proposed both a high-level design, as well as a low-level, detailed architecture of some of the components of the CAMUS system. The sheer number of details that should be examined and studied in this system, as well as the deep complexity surrounding some of them, renders finalizing all of them within the scope of this thesis nigh impossible. However, every small step gets us closer to having a fully operational framework.\\\\
We have tried to propose an architecture, focusing for the most part on the backend of CAMUS. We have studied the different ways and tools that allow us to perform data integration, and ended up developing our own code, which offered us the biggest amount of freedom when it comes to design and optimization strategies. We have successfully implemented these designs, and the early tests we have performed seemed to be quite promising.\\\\
Our data integration model, along with the implementation, were able to fetch data from various heterogeneous sources, integrate the different outputs, making sure that we are extracting everything we need. Adding new services proved to be simple as well: if we follow the guidelines when adding a new service, and provide to the parsers the information pertaining to these new services (as descriptors), then the system will seamlessly integrate the new endpoints into the relevant wrapper, without any extra coding required whatsoever.\\\\
The storage and caching strategies were able to reduce greatly the running time required to perform a full cycle between the backend and the web services. This cycle includes building the requests that need to be sent, customizing them to match what the web services expect to receive in these requests, retrieve and parse the responses, and finally integrate them into one homogenous structure. These operations are quite costly in terms of running time, which is a big constraint when we are considering mobile applications. We were able however to meet this constraint by adding query caching functionalities, as well as saving the end result of the data integration operations in our own database structure.\\\\
Finally yet importantly, we were able to adhere to the context-independence paradigm when designing the various components: the data integration model, as well as the storage mechanisms, work no matter what kind of data we are dealing with, as long as suitable descriptors are provided. We want CAMUS to be a framework that can work for as wide of a variety of domains as possible. To that, the code should not depend on the kind of resources we are dealing with. Naturally, however, in some cases, a domain specialist might be needed to provide insight on how which attributes to include in the CDT and the resource schema. The technical implementation however does not depend on such factors.
\section{Future Work}
Having presented a solid foundation for the back-end component, work can now be done to integrate this component into the rest of the framework. Once the work on the individual components is completed, the system as a whole can be tested to see the accuracy of our context model, and our data integration module can be also further improved.
